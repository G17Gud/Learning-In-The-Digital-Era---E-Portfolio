I have chosen GitHub to create my E-Portfolio for a variety of reasons. These are as follows:
-I am familiar with the website
-I know what the website's capabilities are
-It provides all of the tools I require to complete the task
-It is easy to use (because it has a clear layout)
-It is free to use
-It has millions of users (and so the chances of someone else knowing how to navigate the entire site is high)
-
